      Welcome to orderguide.netlify.app This website provides a searchable web
      interface for the produce departments weekly excel spreadsheet price list.
      If you dont have acess to the spreadsheet you can test run the website
      with the included "load mock data" link. Note: this website is also a
      Progressive web app meaning your browser will ask if you would like to add
      a shortcut to your desktop. This will allow the app to run in offline mode
      and also display in fullscreen mode. It will not give the app access to
      your files and is no less secure than visiting a website.
    </div>
